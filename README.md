# Project_BacaSable

This project is a cooperation between some friends to improve their skills and train themselves in new technologies in a sand box where no arm may be done. Except for people looking at the technical massacre we are about to do here.

## Main technologies:
The main focuses are:

 - <strong>C/C++</strong> in embedded world
 - <strong>CMake</strong>
 - Use of an <strong>RTOS</strong> on symmetric and asymmetric cores
 - <strong>gdb</strong> debugging of multi threaded application
 - <strong>Optimize</strong> of performances, depending on the used hardware architecture
 - Do unit test and hardware in the loop with <strong>Jenkins</strong>
 - Work as a team on a remote project with an <strong>UML architecture</strong>

## Additional features:
Additional technologies/features which may be involved/used:
 - <strong>DSP</strong> programming
 - <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> or machine learning, which may include database handling
 - <strong>Robotics</strong>
 - <strong>Bash</strong> shell scripting
 - <strong>Matlab/Octave</strong> for mathematical analysis

Those additional features are likely to be linked to some application software, which is not purely technical, but represent some personal goals of developers. Those features are therefore likely to be developed in a separate branch.

## Out of scope
Out of scope technologies/features which will not be used in this project, or at least not yet:
 - <strong>IDE</strong> calibration
 - <strong>Hardware</strong> development (PCB, KiCad EDA, circuit analysis and simulation)
 - <strong>FPGA</strong> with VHDL
 - <strong>Website</strong> development
