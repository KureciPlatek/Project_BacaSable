# Architecture Constraints {#section-architecture-constraints}

The aim of this project is to work with some friends which may easily join the project and train themselves. The team work is also a goal of this project for us to train to work with other actors and stakeholders in a project.
For this reason, the needed hardware/infrastructure should be as cheaper as possible.

## Organization constraints

| ID  | Description |
|-------------|:-------------------------|
| *O1* | *Project is a sandbox and contributors will likely want to concentrate development on their own interest. The project must keep a common goal*   |
| *O2* | *Resources needed for project should be as light as possible (costs, place, availability...)* |

## Technical constraints

| ID  | Description |
|-------------|:-------------------------|
| *T1* | *The chosen RTOS must be free to download and use. No money cost should be needed.*   |
| *T2* | *The chosen architecture should be as much available as possible* |
| *T3* | *For facility purpose, only one hardware target will be used at the beginning* |
| *T4* | *Unit test will be applied on one hardware target only* |
| *T5* | *Actually, almost all functional requirements are technical constraints* |

## Conventional constraints
| ID  | Description |
|-------------|:-------------------------|
| *C1* | *TODO - Coding conventions must be respected (naming conventions, indentation, UTF-8 characters only, ANSI-C standard, ...)*   |
